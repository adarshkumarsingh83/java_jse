## static method in interface 
* static method is not related to object and inteface cant be instanciated so its make sense to have staic emthod in inteface 
* calling wihtout object just using Intefacce name for staic method 
* it can't be invoked using implemenation class object becuase its not part of inheritance and instance 
* sysntax 
```
interface Service{

	public static void services(){
		.........implementation........
	}
}
```
