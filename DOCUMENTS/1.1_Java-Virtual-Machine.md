## Java Virtual Machine 
---

```
JVM java virtual machine is the part of the JRE java runtime environment
when we execute the following command then JRE is invoked which internally invoke the JVM
c:\java ClassName <-|
```

### component of the JVM
---
* Class Loader
* Execution Engine (Loader,Linker,ByteCodeVerifier,JIT Compiler,Interpreter)
* Heap(Permanent Generation ,Young Generation)
* Method Area
* Method Stack (Frames)
 frame is used to store data and partial results, as well as to perform dynamic
 linking, return values for methods, and dispatch exceptions.
* Native Method Stack
* Native Method Interface
* Garbage Collector
* Thread pool(thread scheduler)
* Pc Register
* Default Exception Handler
* Run time Constant Pool
* Security Manager

```
For the HotSpot Java VM, the memory pools for serial garbage collection are the following.
Eden Space (heap): The pool from which memory is initially allocated for most objects.
Survivor Space (heap): The pool containing objects that have survived the garbage collection of the Eden space.
Tenured Generation (heap): The pool containing objects that have existed for some time in the survivor space.
Permanent Generation (non-heap): The pool containing all the reflective data of the virtual machine itself, such as class and method objects.
                                 With Java VMs that use class data sharing, this generation is divided into read-only and read-write areas.
Code Cache (non-heap): The HotSpot Java VM also includes a code cache, containing memory that is used for compilation and storage of native code.
```

* Run-Time Data Areas
```
 Java Virtual Machine defines various run-time data areas that are used during
 execution of a program. Some of these data areas are created on Java Virtual
 Machine start-up and are destroyed only when the Java Virtual Machine exits.
