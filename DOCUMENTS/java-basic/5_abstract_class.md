# Abstract Class
---

## Top Level Abstract Class
```
 1.java file name and the public abstract class inside the .java file both names must be same.
 2.one .java file can have multiple java abstract class no restriction on this.
 3.key words for top level abstract class.
    public,abstract,strictfp
 4.top level abstract class can extended only one class at the time 
 5.by default parent of every top level class is java.lang.Object class.
 6.top level abstract class can implement multiple interface at the time.
 7.we can have multiple static block inside a top level abstract class
 8.we can have multiple instance block inside a top level abstract class.
 9.we have have multiple constructor inside the top level abstract class.
 10.we can have static as well as instance method inside the top level abstract class.
 11.we can have abstract method inside the top level abstract class.
 12.we can have inner class inside the top level abstract class.
 13.we can have static nested inner class inside the top level abstract class.
 14.we can have interface inside the top level abstract class.
 15.we can have static interface inside the top level abstract class.
 16.we can overload the methods inside the top level abstract class.
 17.we can override the methods inside the top level abstract class.
 18.we can have instance variable inside the top level abstract class.
 19.we can have static variable inside the top level abstract class
 20.we can have enum in top level class.
 21.without having any abstract method class can be abstract. 
```

## Inner Abstract Class
```
 1.class which is created inside a top level with abstract keyword is abstract inner class.
 2.we can have multiple abstract inner class inside the inner class.
 3.key words for the inner class
   public,private,protected,abstract,strictfp,static
 4.abstract inner class can extended only one class at the time 
 5.by default parent of every abstract inner class is java.lang.Object class.  
 6.inner abstract class can implement multiple interface at the time.
 7.we can have multiple static block inside a inner abstract class but abstract class must be static.
 8.we can have multiple instance block inside a inner abstract class.
 9.we have have multiple constructor inside the inner abstract class.
 10.we can have static as well as instance method inside the inner abstract class but for static method class must be diclared as static.
 11.we can have abstract method inside the inner abstract class.
 12.we can have inner class inside the inner abstract class.
 13.we can have static nested inner class inside the inner abstract class but for that class must be diclared as the static.
 14.we can have interface inside the inner abstract class but inner abstract class must be diclare as the static.
 15.we can have static interface inside the inner abstract class but inner class must be diclare as the static.
 16.we can overload the methods inside the inner abstract class.
 17.we can override the methods inside the inner abstract class.
 18.we can have instance variable inside the inner abstract class.
 19.we can have static variable inside the inner abstract class but inner class must be diclare as the static
 20.we can have enum in inner abstract class.
 21.without having any abstract method inner class can be abstract. 
 ```
 
## Method local Inner Abstract Class 
```
 1.class which is created inside the method is know as method local inner class.
 2.scope of this class is up-to the method execution.
 3.we can have multiple abstract inner class inside the method local abstract inner class.
 4.key words for the inner class
    abstract,strictfp
 5.abstract method local inner class can extended only one class at the time 
 6.by default parent of every abstract method local inner class is java.lang.Object class.  
 7.method local inner abstract class can implement multiple interface at the time. 
 8.we can have multiple instance block inside a method local inner abstract class.
 9.we can't have static block inside a method local inner abstract class .
 10.we have have multiple constructor inside the method local inner abstract class.
 11.we can't have static method but we can have instance method inside the method local inner abstract class .
 12.we can have inner class inside the method local inner abstract class.
 13.we can't have static nested inner class inside the method local inner abstract class.
 14.we can't have interface inside the method local inner abstract class.
 15.we can't have static interface inside the method local inner abstract class.
 16.we can overload the methods inside the method local inner abstract class.
 17.we can override the methods inside the method local inner abstract class.
 18.we can have instance variable inside the method local inner abstract class.
 19.we can't have static variable inside the method local inner abstract class.
 20.we can have enum in method local inner abstract class.
 21.without having any abstract method method local inner class can be abstract.
