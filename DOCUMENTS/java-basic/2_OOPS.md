# Object Orient Principals
----
```
OOPS the the concept of mapping the real world things to the programming it provide different ways by which 
we can map the real worlds entities( people ,objects ,things ) with the programming environments and components 
and provide the behaviour to those components so that it can simulate the real world things in the programming environment.
```

### Encapsulation
```
 Its the process of binding the properties and functionality together.its said to be implemented when we have 
 private properties and those are accessed by public method those method are internally using those private 
 properties and providing restricted accessed to those properties of the class. 
```

### Data Abstraction
```
 Its the process of hiding the internal implementation from the external user and offering only the required features which 
is relevant to that particular user.in other words its the process of hiding the complexities from the external entities and 
offering only the relevant features which is required for that external entities in that why we are providing security and maintainability 
to the system becoz external entities doesn't know about the internal implementation and we can change the implementation at any point of 
time without effecting the external entities.
```

### Inheritance
```
Its the process of the establishing the parent and child relationship between the classes for providing the reusable of the functionality
and features in that way we are saving development time and cost 
```

### Polymorphism
```
When system behaves differently on the basic of input supplied to it in this case the output differs on the basic of input supplied to the 
system in this we have overloading and overriding which is early binding and late binding,In this case interface will be single but the implementation
will behaves different on the basic of input supplied.
```

### Modularity 
```
Its the Process of developing the components in such a way that it can be loosely couple and the reuse the components as more as possible  
```

* Class
```
=> Class A template that describes the kinds of state and behaviour that objects of its type support.
```

* Object
```
=> Object At runtime, when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) encounters the
new keyword, it will use the appropriate class to make an object which is an
instance of that class. That object will have its own state, and access to all of
the behaviours defined by its class.
```

* State 
```
=> State (instance variables) Each object (instance of a class) will have its
own unique set of instance variables as defined in the class. Collectively, the
values assigned to an object's instance variables make up the object's state.

```

* Behaviour
```
=> Behaviour (methods) When a programmer creates a class, she creates methods
for that class. Methods are where the class' logic is stored. Methods are
where the real work gets done. They are where algorithms get executed, and
data gets manipulated.
